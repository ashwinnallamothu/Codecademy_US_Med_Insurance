# Codecademy_US_Med_Insurance
Codecademy Data Science: Analytics Career Path has provided a dataset with which I was fortunate enough to play around with and run some fundamental analysis strategies on.

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict medical insurance costs based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. By developing machine learning models, we explore patterns in the data and provide insights into the key factors influencing insurance charges.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- scikit-learn (>=0.24)
- pandas (>=1.1)
- matplotlib (>=3.3)
- seaborn (>=0.11)

## Data Description

The dataset contains information about individuals' medical insurance costs, including age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-Feature Engineering
-Model Training and Evaluation
-Visualization
-Results and Insights

Our analysis reveals that smoking status and age have the most significant impact on medical insurance costs. The Gradient Boosting model outperforms other models in predicting charges.

## Future Improvements

- Include more demographic features for a comprehensive analysis.
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.
- Incorporate additional datasets to enhance predictions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!
